## Steps to run
We recommended to run various versions of Node/npm is via NVM ( Node Version Manager )
if you don't have it already installed check it out [ Installing NVM here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

Or just use Node v10.16.3 ( what we used to test this service )
``` sh
$> node -v
v10.16.3
$>  npm -v
6.9.0
```



```
